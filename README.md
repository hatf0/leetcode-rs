# leetcode-rs
This repository contains all of my Rust solutions to Leetcode problems.

## Goals
- Write solutions in an idiomatic Rust way (e.g. implementing traits, using higher-order functions, etc)
- Avoid writing solutions that depend on external crates
  - Fine for initial prototypes, but the final solution should be written idiomatically
- Don't needlessly optimize if the bruteforce solution is "Good Enough"

## Problems Solved
