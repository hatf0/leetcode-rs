# leetcode-rs
This repository contains all of my Rust solutions to Leetcode problems.

## Goals
- Write solutions in an idiomatic Rust way (e.g. implementing traits, using higher-order functions, etc)
- Avoid writing solutions that depend on external crates
  - Fine for initial prototypes, but the final solution should be written idiomatically
- Don't needlessly optimize if the bruteforce solution is "Good Enough"

## Problems Solved
### Easy
- [x] 9. Palindrome Number (Easy)
- [x] 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)
- [x] 125. Valid Palindrome (Easy)

### Medium
- [x] 2. Add Two Numbers (Medium)
- [x] 7. Reverse Integer (Medium)
- [x] 11. Container with Most Water (Medium)
- [x] 12. Integer to Roman (Medium)

### Hard
- [x] 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)

## Problems In-Progress
### Easy
### Medium
- [ ] 5. Longest Palindromic Substring: brute-force solution only, need to optimize (Medium)
- [ ] 15. 3Sum: brute-force solution only, need to optimize (Medium)
### Hard
- [ ] 10. Regular Expression Matching (Hard)
